### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have a strong background in computer science and optoelectronics, with skills in various programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Spring Boot, NodeJS, Express, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, MySql, MongoDB, React and Angular. I hold a BSc in Physics, a master's and a PhD in Optoelectronics. I have been recognized by Petrobras for my innovative optical fiber sensor proposal and I have two patents in this field. I am fluent in English, with a TOEIC score of 965/990. I also have teaching experience as a part-time college professor and extensive professional experience as a technical representative and an administrator of a small sales business in the utilities sector (water, gas and electricity).
I look forward to hearing from you.
